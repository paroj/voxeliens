Software and libraries used
---------------------------
The rendering engine of Voxeliens is built upon Ogre3D, an open souce graphics engine which offers a lot of power and flexibility. Nokia's Qt toolkit was used for most other aspects of the game including audio and input handling.

We were also dependent upon an number of open source asset creation tools including Blender, the Gimp, Sproxel, Audacity, VirtualDub and MeshLab. These all performed superbly at their respective tasks.
